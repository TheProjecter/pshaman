===* IMPLEMENTATION THAT NEEDS DONE BEFORE 2.0.11 RELEASE*===
-----
rev26~~ - Currently looking for ways to implement all restoration talents. Riptide to be precise.

rev21~~ - Currently looking for ways to implement Cleanse Spirit Skill. ~~  

rev26~~ - Update the look of the Config, perhaps add a restoration tab just for the talents.

rev21~~      - Fix some totems issues, Totem of Wrath for example is listed as a Fire totem, it isn't anymore. ~~

rev28~~      - Release a non-pather version. This seems to be popular. ~~ Thanks Hawker.

rev28~~      - Totem Recall isn't working properly. It mounts, run away from the totems, press "totem recall" and remounts. ~~

rev28~~      - Improve on PVP code. I fail at this, will let someone look at it and improve on it.~~


rev26~~ - If a mob is below a certain % health threshold we need to cancel out PShamans healing and focus on finishing off the mob.

===* IMPLEMENTATION FOR FUTURE RELEASES*===

      - Support for Earth Shielding any Player done by selection on the Config. Athene does it with Paladin buffs maybe look at how it's done over there.
